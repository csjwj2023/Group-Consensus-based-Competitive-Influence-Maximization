# Group-Consensus-based-Competitive-Influence-Maximization
We introduce the process  of group consensus reaching in influence maximization and propose a novel Group consensus-based Competitive Linear Threshold  (GCLT) propagation model; then we study the Budgeted Competitive Influence Maximization (BCIM) problem under the GCLT model.
